Codeforces #705 div 2 A

Q) You are given two integers n and k. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to n so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to k.
A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.

Input
The first line contains the number of test cases T (1≤T≤100).
Each of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (1≤k≤n≤1000) — the description of test cases.

Output
For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer m — the number of chosen integers.
In the second line output m distinct integers from 1 to n — the chosen numbers.
If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.

Solution ->
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
typedef long long int ll;
using namespace std;
int main(){
	ll t;cin>>t;while(t--){
		ll n,k;
		cin>>n>>k;
		vector<int> c;

		int a = 0;
		
		a = k/2;
		if(k&1){
			a+=1;
		}
		while(a<=n){
			if(a==k){a++;continue;}
			c.push_back(a);
			a++;
		}
		cout<<c.size()<<"\n";
		for(auto i : c){
			cout<<i<<" ";
		}
	cout<<endl;	
	}//while
 
return 0;
}
