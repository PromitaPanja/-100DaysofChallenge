hackerearth practice problem 
A) Equalize strings

Problem-
You are given two binary strings S and T of the same length N. Your task is to make both the strings equal. Perform the following operation on string S:

Select any substring of S then flip all 1's to 0 and flip all 0's to 1 of that substring.

Print the minimum number of operations you have to perform to make them equal.

Input format
* The first line contains a single integer N (1<=N<=1e5) size of each string
* The second line contains a string S of length N. 
* The third line contains a string T of length N. 

Output format
Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of operations required to make both the strings equal.

Constraints
1<=N<=1e5

Sample Input
2
10
11
Sample Output
1
Time Limit: 1
Memory Limit: 256
Source Limit:
Explanation
You just need to flip second 0 to 1. 
So answer is 1.

Solution->

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;										// Reading input from STDIN
	//cout << "Input number is " << num << endl;
	string s,t;
	cin>>s;
	cin>>t;
	int c=0;
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		if(s[i]!=t[i]){
			while(s[i]!=t[i]){
				i++;
			}
			c++;
		}
	}
	cout<<c;
}
