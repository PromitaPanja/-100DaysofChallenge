Google round A 2020 (practice prblm for me)
1) Allocation
Problem
There are N houses for sale. The i-th house costs Ai dollars to buy. You have a budget of B dollars to spend.

What is the maximum number of houses you can buy?

Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a single line containing the two integers N and B. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai, the cost of the i-th house.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum number of houses you can buy.

Limits
Time limit: 15 seconds per test set.
Memory limit: 1GB.
1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
1 ≤ B ≤ 105.
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000, for all i.
Test set 1
1 ≤ N ≤ 100.
Test set 2
1 ≤ N ≤ 105.
Sample

Input
 	
Output
 
3
4 100
20 90 40 90
4 50
30 30 10 10
3 300
999 999 999

  
Case #1: 2
Case #2: 3
Case #3: 0

  
In Sample Case #1, you have a budget of 100 dollars. You can buy the 1st and 3rd houses for 20 + 40 = 60 dollars.
In Sample Case #2, you have a budget of 50 dollars. You can buy the 1st, 3rd and 4th houses for 30 + 10 + 10 = 50 dollars.
In Sample Case #3, you have a budget of 300 dollars. You cannot buy any houses (so the answer is 0).

        k-=a[i];
        c++;

        else break;
    }
    
    cout << "Case #" << j+1 << ": "<<c;
	cout<<"\n";
