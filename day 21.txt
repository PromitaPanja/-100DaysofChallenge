A) MOTIVATION IMDB
Chef has been searching for a good motivational movie that he can watch during his exam time. His hard disk has X GB of space remaining. His friend has N movies represented with (Si,Ri) representing (space required, IMDB rating). Help Chef choose the single best movie (highest IMDB rating) that can fit in his hard disk.

B)Turn It NFS

Chef is playing Need For Speed. Currently, his car is running on a straight road with a velocity U metres per second and approaching a 90∘ turn which is S metres away from him. To successfully cross the turn, velocity of the car when entering the turn must not exceed V metres per second.

The brakes of Chef's car allow him to slow down with a deceleration (negative acceleration) not exceeding A metres per squared second. Tell him whether he can cross the turn successfully. The velocity v when entering the turn can be determined from Newton's 2nd law to be v2=U2+2⋅a⋅S if the car is moving with a uniform acceleration a.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers U, V, A and S.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if Chef can cross the turn successfully or "No" if he cannot (without quotes).
Constraints
1≤T≤105
1≤U,V,A,S≤104
Example Input
3
1 1 1 1
2 1 1 1
2 2 1 1
Example Output
Yes
No
Yes
Explanation
Example case 1: Since U=V=1, Chef does not need to brake and will be able to turn successfully.

Example case 2: The smallest velocity Chef's car can have even with the maximum deceleration is 2⋅2−2⋅1⋅1−−−−−−−−−−−√=2–√, which is greater than the maximum allowed velocity for a safe turn.

Example case 3: The smallest velocity Chef's car can have with the maximum deceleration is again 2–√, which is smaller than the maximum allowed velocity for a safe turn.

#define IOS ios::sync_with_stdio(0);

    cin>>u>>v>>a>>s;
    if(u==1 && v==1){cout<<"Yes\n";continue;}
    float acc = u*u - 2*a*s;
    if(acc<0){cout<<"Yes\n";continue;}
    acc = pow(acc,0.5);
 //   cout<<"ACC "<<acc<<"\n";
    (acc<=v)?cout<<"Yes\n":cout<<"No\n";

    //cout<<endl;

3) Make the Sum Even MKSMEVN

Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. In one operation, Chef can choose one index i (1≤i≤N) and change Ai to Api, where p=max(0,⌈Ai2⌉−1).

Help Chef find the smallest number of operations needed to make the sum of the sequence even or determine that it is impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum of the sequence even, or −1 if it is impossible.

Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points):

2
9 9
3
1 1 1
Example Output
0
1
0
-1
Explanation
Example case 1: The sum of the sequence is 16, which is already even.

Example case 2: We can change A2 to 1, so that the sequence becomes [4,1,7,8,10]. The sum of this sequence is 30, which is even.

Example case 3: The sum of the sequence is 18, which is already even.

Example case 4: It is impossible to make the sum of the sequence even.
