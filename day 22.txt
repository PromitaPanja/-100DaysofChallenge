1) Possible Victory T20MCH
Chef is playing in a T20 cricket match. In a match, Team A plays for 20 overs. In a single over, the team gets to play 6 times, and in each of these 6 tries, they can score a maximum of 6 runs. After Team A's 20 overs are finished, Team B similarly plays for 20 overs and tries to get a higher total score than the first team. The team with the higher total score at the end wins the match.

Chef is in Team B. Team A has already played their 20 overs, and have gotten a score of R. Chef's Team B has started playing, and have already scored C runs in the first O overs. In the remaining 20−O overs, find whether it is possible for Chef's Team B to get a score high enough to win the game. That is, can their final score be strictly larger than R?
Sample Input 1:
719 18 648

Sample Output 1:
YES
 Solution->
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int r,o,c;
	cin>>r>>o>>c;
	int ans = (20-c)*36 + 72;
	if(ans>r){
	    cout<<"Yes";
	}
	else
	{cout<<"No";}
	return 0;

2) Nobel Prize NOBEL
The growth of Computer Science has forced the scientific community to award Nobel Prize in CS starting from this year.

Chef knows that the Nobel community is going to award the prize to that person whose research is different from others (ie. no other researcher should work on the same topic). If there are multiple such people, who work on unique topics, then they will all share the prize. It might also happen that no one wins this time.

Chef also knows the N researchers which the community who will be considered for the prize, and the topics in which each of them work.

In total the CS field can be divided into M broad topics. Given the topics in which each of the N researchers are working on, in the form of an array A, and given that Chef can master any topic instantly, find whether he can win the prize. That is, can the Chef choose to work on some topic which will guarantee that he will win the prize? Chef doesn't mind sharing the prize with others.
