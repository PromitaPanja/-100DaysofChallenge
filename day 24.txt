Dinner by Candlelight (DATE1)
Chef is having a candlelit dinner with his girlfriend at his place. Currently, it is time 0, Chef just managed to light a candle, but he is out of matchsticks.

Since Chef has an infinite supply of (unlit) candles, he can use the following strategy: each second (starting at time 0), he takes one lit candle and lights up X other candles using it. This process takes 1 unit of time to complete, i.e. if Chef starts lighting up X candles at a time t1, he is able to finish at the time t1+1.

However, since candle wax is limited, a candle can only burn for Y units of time and then it is extinguished.

Chef's girlfriend arrives at a time A — specifically, after all the candles that were supposed to get extinguished at time A have been extinguished and after Chef lights up all the candles that he was lighting up since time A−1. Now Chef wants to know the maximum number of candles which can be lit at the time A to impress his girlfriend.
