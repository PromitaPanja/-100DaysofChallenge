Leetcode (EASY) 389. Find The Difference
(SBM)
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Soltuion->
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        map<char,int> a,b;
        char ans;
        int l = t.size();
        for(int i=0;i<l;i++){
            if(i<=l-2){
            a[s[i]]++;}
            b[t[i]]++;
        }
        for(char i='a';i<='z';i++){
            if(a[i]!=b[i]){ans = i;break;}
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
Leetcode (EASY) 136.Single Number
(SBM)
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.


Solution->
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& a) {
        int ans ;
        int l = a.size();
        map<int,int> m;

        for(int i=0;i<l;++i){
            m[a[i]]++;
        }
        for(auto i:m){
            if(i.second==1){ans = i.first;break;}
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
