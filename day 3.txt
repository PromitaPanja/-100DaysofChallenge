Weird Fibonacci prblm code: PH104
(SBM)
In order to celebrate Women's day, Stella started playing with the Fibonacci series and wanted to make her own version of it, the Wierd Fibonacci series.
Given a normal Fibonacci series upto N, i.e., A1, A2, A3, ..., AN-1, AN.
The resulting Weird Fibonacci Sequence from above sequence is A1, AN, A2, AN-1, ..., AN/2.
For a given N, print the first M numbers for this series.
As the numbers can be very big, print the number modulo 1000000007.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,M.

Output:
For each testcase, output M space-separated integers in the order described above, all in a single line.

Constraints
1≤T≤10000
1≤M≤10
1≤N≤106
Sample Input:
1
10 6
Sample Output:
0 34 1 21 1 13
Explanation:
For N=10 Fibonacci series would be: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
And is the above order it would be: [0, 34, 1, 21, 1, 13, 2, 8, 3, 5]
To print first M numbers: 0 34 1 21 1 13

Solution -> 

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
typedef long long int ll;
#define mod 1000000007
using namespace std;

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
 	cin.tie(NULL);cout.tie(NULL);
 	ll a[1000000];
    ll p1=1,p2=1;
    a[0] = 0;
    a[1] = 1;
    a[2] = 1;
    for(ll i=3;i<1000000;i++){
        a[i] = (p1 + p2) % mod;
        p1 = p2;
        p2 = a[i] % mod;
    }
    
	ll t;cin>>t;while(t--){
    ll n,m;
    cin>>n>>m;
    
    
    ll j=0,f=n-1;
    for(ll i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(m==0){break;}
        else cout<<(a[i] % mod)<<" ";m--;
        if(m==0){break;}
        cout<<(a[f] % mod)<<" ";m--;
        f--;
    }
    
	cout<<"\n";
}
return 0;
