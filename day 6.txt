codeforce #1462 A)
(SBM)
Polycarp has a favorite sequence a[1…n] consisting of n integers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:

he wrote the number a1 to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard);
he wrote the number a2 to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard);
then as far to the left as possible (but to the right from a1), he wrote the number a3;
then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from a2), he wrote the number a4;
Polycarp continued to act as well, until he wrote out the entire sequence on the whiteboard.
The beginning of the result looks like this (of course, if n≥4).
For example, if n=7 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2], then Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard [3,4,5,2,9,1,1].

You saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite sequence.

Input
The first line contains a single positive integer t (1≤t≤300) — the number of test cases in the test. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤300) — the length of the sequence written on the whiteboard.

The next line contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤109) — the sequence written on the whiteboard.

Output
Output t answers to the test cases. Each answer — is a sequence a that Polycarp wrote out on the whiteboard.

Example:
6
7
3 4 5 2 9 1 1
4
9 2 7 1
11
8 4 3 1 2 7 8 7 9 4 2
1
42
2
11 7
8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
output:
3 1 4 1 5 9 2 
9 1 2 7 
8 2 4 4 3 9 1 7 2 8 7 
42 
11 7 
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
